# Sounds Directory

This directory is reserved for game sound effects and background music.

## Purpose
Place audio files here for future sound implementation:
- Background music
- Food eating sound effects
- Game over sounds
- Button click sounds
- Collision sounds

## Recommended Formats
- MP3 (widely supported)
- WAV (high quality, larger files)
- OGG (good compression, modern browsers)

## Implementation
When adding sounds:
1. Place audio files in this directory
2. Add audio elements or Web Audio API code to the game
3. Update [constants.js](../../constants.js) if needed for audio settings
4. Consider adding volume controls in the UI
